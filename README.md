## Configuration


- Input the name and surname together at position (A1) i.e (John Doe), and company domain URL at position (B1) i.e (www.example.com). 
- The email permutations would appear under column (C).

- The script uses various patterns to generate email permutations, such as first name, last name, initials, hyphenation, and underscore. You can modify the `generatePermutations` function to include or customize additional patterns however you like.


## Limitations

- This script assumes that the company address domain is in the format of "www.example.com". You can also modify the code in the `generatePermutations` function to extract the domain correctly.


Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your needs.
